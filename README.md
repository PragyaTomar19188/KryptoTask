Import Psycopg2

Psycopg is the most popular PostgreSQL database adapter for the Python
programming language.  Its main features are the complete implementation of
the Python DB API 2.0 specification and the thread safety (several threads can
share the same connection).  It was designed for heavily multi-threaded
applications that create and destroy lots of cursors and make a large number
of concurrent "INSERT"s or "UPDATE"s.

If prerequisites are met, you can install psycopg like any other Python
package, using ``pip`` to download it from PyPI_::

    $ pip install psycopg2
    
Give your connection details in the conn section to connect to Postgre database in your system!
